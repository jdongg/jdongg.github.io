High Order Finite Volume Methods Last time, we established that the explicit first order finite volume scheme is given by $$ \\begin{equation} \\bar{u}_{j}^{n+1} = \\bar{u}_{j}^{n} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\left( \\hat{f}(\\bar{u}_{j}^{n}, \\bar{u}_{j+1}^{n}) - \\hat{f}(\\bar{u}_{j-1}^{n}, \\bar{u}_{j}^{n}) \\right), \\label{eq:finitevol2} \\end{equation} $$ where $\\bar{u}_{j}^{n}$ denotes the cell averages at time $t^{n}$ and $\\bar{u}_{j}^{n+1}$ the cell averages at time $t^{n+1} = t^{n} + \\Delta t$. Here, $\\hat{f}$ is the numerical flux function which takes as inputs cell averages and returns an approximation of the flux function at the cell endpoints $x_{j+1/ 2}$, i.e. $f(u_{j+1/ 2}) \\approx \\hat{f}(\\bar{u}_{j}, \\bar{u}_{j+1})$ and $f(u_{j-1/ 2}) \\approx \\hat{f}(\\bar{u}_{j-1}, \\bar{u}_{j})$.\nMore generally, we can view the quantity $\\bar{u}_{j}$ as a first order (zero degree polynomial) reconstruction of $u(x)$ in cell $I_{j}$ using the cell average. The same can be said of $\\bar{u}_{j+1}$ in cell $I_{j+1}$. By approximating $u(x_{j+1/ 2}^{-}) = u_{j+1/ 2}^{-} \\approx \\bar{u}_{j}$ on the left “side” of $x_{j+1/ 2}$ and $u(x_{j+1/ 2}^{+}) = u_{j+1/ 2}^{+} \\approx \\bar{u}_{j+1}$ on the right side of $x_{j+1/ 2}$, the numerical flux has a natural interpretation as $f(u_{j+1/ 2}) \\approx \\hat{f}(u_{j+1/ 2}^{-}, u_{j+1/ 2}^{+})$. We reconcile the two reconstructions at $x_{j+1/ 2}$ by utilizing the numerical flux function. Figure 1 illustrates this concept.\nFigure 1: First order reconstruction. We reconstruct $u$ using a zero degree polynomial (i.e. constant functions) in each cell. 1.1 Polynomial Reconstruction Viewing the finite volume scheme as a reconstruction procedure using the cell averages is key to developing higher order methods. Using $\\eqref{eq:finitevol2}$, we have $u_{j+1/ 2}^{-} = \\bar{u}_{j} + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x)$. Suppose we want to develop a third-order finite volume scheme now. In particular, we would like to have $$ u_{j+1/ 2}^{-} = \\mathcal{F}(\\bar{u}_{j-p}, \\dots, \\bar{u}_{j+q}) + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^{3}), $$\nwhere $p$ and $q$ are integers to be chosen by us. It stands to reason that if we want a third-order reconstruction of $u(x)$ in cell $I_{j}$, we need to use three “pieces” of information: $u_{j+1/ 2}^{-} \\approx \\mathcal{F}(\\bar{u}_{j-1}, \\bar{u}_{j}, \\bar{u}_{j+1})$. In other words, we are seeking a degree two polynomial $p_{j}(x) = ax^{2} + bx + c$ in $I_{j}$ such that $u_{j+1/ 2}^{-} = p_{j}(x_{j+1/ 2}) + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^{3})$. In order to fully determine this polynomial, i.e. solve for $a,b,c$, we require three equations. A natural condition to impose on $p_{j}$ is that it preserves cell averages over the stencil $\\{I_{j-1}, I_{j}, I_{j+1}\\}$: $$ \\begin{equation} \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} \\int_{I_{i}} p_{j}(x);dx = \\bar{u}_{i}, ;;;i \\in \\{j-1,j,j+1\\}. \\end{equation} $$\nWe then take $u_{j+1/ 2}^{-} = p_{j}(x_{j+1/ 2})$. Similarly, we take $u_{j+1/ 2}^{+} = p_{j+1}(x_{j+1/ 2})$. Figure 2 demonstrates how the third-order reconstruction procedure works.\nFigure 2: Third order reconstruction. We reconstruct $u$ using a quadratic function defined in the stencil $\\{I_{j-1}, I_{j}, I_{j+1}\\}$ and enforce that the quadratic function maintains cell averages across the stencil. We take $u_{j+1/ 2}^{-} \\approx p_{j}(x_{j+1 /2})$ and $u_{j+1/ 2}^{+} \\approx p_{j+1}(x_{j+1/ 2})$ (not pictured here). Definition 1. The order $k$ in space finite volume scheme is given by $$ \\begin{equation} \\frac{d\\bar{u}_{j}}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\Delta x}\\left( \\hat{f}(u_{j+1/ 2}^{-}, u_{j+1/ 2}^{+}) - \\hat{f}(u_{j-1/ 2}^{-}, u_{j-1/ 2}^{+}) \\right) = 0 \\label{eq:finitevolk} \\end{equation} $$ where $u_{j+1/ 2}^{-} \\approx p_{j}(x_{j+1/ 2})$ and $u_{j+1/ 2}^{+} \\approx p_{j+1}(x_{j+1/ 2})$. The degree $k-1$ polynomial $p_{j}$ is reconstructed from the stencil $\\{\\bar{u}_{j-p}, \\dots, \\bar{u}_{j+q}\\}$ and satifies the $q+p+1$ conditions $$ \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} \\int_{I_{i}} p_{j}(x);dx = \\bar{u}_{i}, ;;;i \\in \\{j-p, \\dots, j+q\\}. $$\nFor concreteness, we will work with the third-order scheme. It is a straightforward (if tedious) pen and paper exercise to compute the parameters $a,b,c$ for the polynomial $p_{j}(x) = ax^{2}+bx+c$. However, notice that the scheme $\\eqref{eq:finitevolk}$ only requires the evaluation of the polynomials at the endpoints of the cells. For the third order scheme, this amounts to the following formulae: $$ \\begin{align} u_{j+1/ 2}^{-} \u0026amp;= p_{j}(x_{j+1/ 2}) = -\\frac{1}{6}\\bar{u}_{j-1} + \\frac{5}{6}\\bar{u}_{j} + \\frac{1}{3}\\bar{u}_{j+1}\\label{eq:recon1}\\\\\\ u_{j+1/ 2}^{+} \u0026amp;= p_{j+1}(x_{j+1/ 2}) = \\frac{1}{3}\\bar{u}_{j} + \\frac{5}{6}\\bar{u}_{j+1} - \\frac{1}{6}\\bar{u}_{j+2}.\\label{eq:recon2} \\end{align} $$\nThese formulae can be found in a number of references, e.g. Chapter 4 of [3].\nBefore moving on, we should make note of two very important issues here. The first is that $\\eqref{eq:finitevolk}$ is only a semidiscrete scheme – we haven’t discretized time yet!

Conservation Laws In this post, we’ll take a look at conservation laws, the contexts in which they arise in nature, and some of the numerical methods used for solving them. In one spatial-dimension, conservation laws take the general form $$ \\begin{equation} \\begin{cases} u_{t} + f(u)_{x} = 0 \u0026amp;\\text{in}\\;\\mathbb{R} \\times [0,\\infty)\\\\ u(x,0) = u_{0}(x) \u0026amp;\\text{on}\\;\\mathbb{R} \\times \\{t=0\\}. \\end{cases} \\label{eq:conslaw} \\end{equation} $$ Here, we consider the spatial domain to be the entire real line (thus, we have no boundary conditions). The function $f(u)$ – typically called the flux function – is sufficiently smooth. As their name suggests, conservation laws preserve mass. We often think of the quantity $u$ as the density of some fluid, in which case $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} u(x,t)dx$ may be viewed as the mass of fluid. If we assume that $u$ is compactly supported in $x$ (i.e. it is nonzero outside of some compact set in $x$, a reasonable assumption as the fluid should have finite mass) and $f(0) = 0$, then taking derivatives over time yields $$ \\begin{align} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u(x,t);dx \u0026amp;= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t};dx = -\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\partial f(u)}{\\partial x};dx\\notag\\\\\\ \u0026amp;= f(u(-\\infty)) - f(u(\\infty)) = 0.\\notag \\end{align} $$\nThe above computation implies that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} u(x,t);dx = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} u(x,0);dx$: the mass of $u$ is conserved over time.\nTo gain some intuition for how solutions of this PDE might behave, we’ll first consider the simplest conservation law there is: the linear advection equation. Taking $f(u) = u$, it is evident that our solution is given by $u(x,t) = u_{0}(x-t)$. The PDE “transports” the initial profile in the $x$ direction. In particular, we note that the solution to the linear conservation law is exactly as smooth as our initial data. That is, if $u_{0} \\in C^{1}_{x}(\\mathbb{R})$ then $u \\in C_{x}^{1}(\\mathbb{R})$ as well. We haven’t said anything particularly illuminating thus far and indeed, the linear advection equation isn’t particularly interesting to begin with.\nNext, let’s consider a simple nonlinear conservation law: $$ \\begin{cases} u_{t} + uu_{x} = 0 \u0026amp;\\text{in};\\mathbb{R} \\times [0,\\infty)\\\\\\ u(x,0) = \\sin{x} \u0026amp;\\text{on};\\mathbb{R} \\times \\{t=0\\}. \\end{cases} $$\nThe initial condition is as smooth as possible now: $\\sin{x} \\in C_{x}^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R})$. But what can we say about $u(x,t)$? Should we still expect it to be smooth in $x$? It turns out that the answer is a resounding no. In fact, solutions to the above nonlinear PDE (known as Burgers equation) are not even $C_{x}^{0}(\\mathbb{R})$! The exact mathematical cause of this phenomena is due to the crossing of something called characteristic curves, but we will first consider a more intuitive explanation.\nWe may view Burgers equation as an advection equation in which the speed of propagation is equal to $u$ itself. Our initial sine profile thus moves with variable speed in $x$. For $0 \\leqslant x \\leqslant \\pi$, the sine wave is positive and the solution travels forward. For $\\pi \u0026lt; x \\leqslant 2\\pi$, the sine wave is negative and the solution travels backwards. The animation below shows how the solution of Burgers equation evolves over time, and we see the development of a genuine discontinuity at $x=\\pi$. Figure 1: Solution of Burgers equation with sine initial data. Shocks such as the one above occur naturally in many settings, for instance high-speed compressible flows and aeroacoustics. However, a natural question we might ask next is how discontinuities and shocks fit with our notion of the classical solution of a PDE. For instance, the linear advection equation contains a first-order time derivative and a first-order spatial derivative. Naturally, we should require that $u \\in C_{x,t}^{1}(\\mathbb{R} \\times [0,\\infty))$ – our solution should be once differentiable in space and time. Consider, though, the linear advection equation with $u(x,0) = 𝟙_{\\{x \\leqslant 0\\}}$. You’ll probably agree with me that the only possible solution to this problem is $u(x,t) = 𝟙_{\\{x \\leqslant t\\}}$, and yet this “solution” is not even continuous let alone differentiable. Before moving on to numerical solvers, we will spend some time developing alternative notions of PDE solutions that are capable of admitting discontinuities and shocks.\n1.2 Weak Solutions of Conservation Laws Definition 1. We call $u(x,t)$ a weak solution of the conservation law $\\eqref{eq:conslaw}$ if $$ \\begin{equation} \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u\\varphi_{t} + f(u)\\varphi_{x};dxdt = -\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u(x,0)\\varphi(x,0);dx \\label{eq:weaksol} \\end{equation} $$\nfor all $\\varphi \\in C_{c}^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R})$.\nWe refer to $\\varphi$ as a test function. It is smooth in both space and time and compactly supported, i.e. $\\varphi$ is zero outside of some compact set in space and time.
