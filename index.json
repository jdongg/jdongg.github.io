Conservation Laws In this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll take a look at conservation laws, the contexts in which they arise in nature, and some of the numerical methods used for solving them. In one spatial-dimension, conservation laws take the general form $$ \\begin{cases} u_{t} + f(u)_{x} = 0 \u0026amp;\\text{in}\\;\\mathbb{R} \\times [0,\\infty)\\\\\nu(x,0) = u_{0}(x) \u0026amp;\\text{on}\\;\\mathbb{R} \\times \\{t=0\\}. \\end{cases} $$\nHere, we consider the spatial domain to be the entire real line (thus, we have no boundary conditions). The function $f(u)$ \u0026ndash; typically called the flux function \u0026ndash; is sufficiently smooth. To gain some intuition for how solutions of this PDE might behave, we\u0026rsquo;ll first consider the simplest conservation law there is: the linear advection equation.\nTaking $f(u) = u$, it is evident that our solution is given by $u(x,t) = u_{0}(x-t)$. In particular, we note that the solution to the linear conservation law is exactly as smooth as our initial data. That is, if $u_{0} \\in C^{1}_{x}(\\mathbb{R})$ then $u \\in C_{x}^{1}(\\mathbb{R})$ as well. We haven\u0026rsquo;t said anything particularly illuminating thus far and indeed, the linear advection equation isn\u0026rsquo;t particularly interesting to begin with.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s consider a simple nonlinear conservation law now: $$ \\begin{cases} u_{t} + uu_{x} = 0 \u0026amp;\\text{in}\\;\\mathbb{R} \\times [0,\\infty)\\\\\nu(x,0) = \\sin{x} \u0026amp;\\text{on}\\;\\mathbb{R} \\times \\{t=0\\}. \\end{cases} $$\nThe initial condition is as smooth as possible now: $\\sin{x} \\in C_{x}^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R})$. But what can we say about $u(x,t)$? Should we still expect it to be smooth in $x$? It turns out that the answer is a resounding no. In fact, solutions to the above nonlinear PDE (known as Burgers equation) are not even $C_{x}^{0}(\\mathbb{R})$! The exact cause of this phenomena is due to the crossing of characteristic curves, but we will first consider a more intuitive explanation.\nWe may view Burgers equation as an advection equation in which the speed of propagation is equal to $u$ itself. Our initial sine profile thus moves with variable speed in $x$. For $0 \\leqslant x \\leqslant \\pi$, the sine wave is positive and the solution travels forward. For $\\pi \u0026lt; x \\leqslant 2\\pi$, the sine wave is negative and the solution travels backwards. The animation below shows how the solution of Burgers equation evolves over time, and we see the development of a genuine discontinuity at $x=\\pi$.   Figure 1: Solution of Burgers equation with sine initial data.  \nShocks such as the one above occur naturally in many settings, for instance high-speed compressible flows and aeroacoustics. However, a natural question we might ask next is how discontinuities and shocks fit with our notion of the classical solution of a PDE. For instance, the linear advection equation contains a first-order time derivative and a first-order spatial derivative. Naturally, we should require that $u \\in C_{x,t}^{1}(\\mathbb{R} \\times [0,\\infty))$ \u0026ndash; our solution should be once differentiable in space and time. Consider, though, the linear advection equation with $u(x,0) = 𝟙_{x \\leqslant 0}$. You\u0026rsquo;ll probably agree with me that the only possible solution to this problem is $u(x,t) = 𝟙_{x \\leqslant t}$, and yet this \u0026ldquo;solution\u0026rdquo; is not even continuous let alone differentiable. Before moving on to numerical solvers, we will spend some time developing alternative notions of PDE solutions that are capable of admitting discontinuities and shocks.\n1.2 Weak Solutions of Conservation Laws Definition 1. We call $u(x,t)$ a weak solution of the conservation law if $$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u\\varphi_{t} + f(u)\\varphi_{x}\\;dxdt = -\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u(x,0)\\varphi(x,0)\\;dx $$\nfor all $\\varphi \\in C_{c}^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R})$.\nWe refer to $\\varphi$ as a test function. It is smooth in both space and time and compactly supported, i.e. $\\varphi$ is zero outside of some compact set in space and time. Let\u0026rsquo;s break down what\u0026rsquo;s actually going on in the definition of the weak solution. The most notable feature is that if $u$ is a weak solution, it does not have to be differentiable in space or time since the definition only contains derivatives of $\\varphi$!\nSo how do we arrive at this definition? First, we multiply the entire conservation law by $\\varphi$: $$ u_{t}\\varphi + f(u)_{x}\\varphi = 0. $$\nThen, we integrate in time over $[0,\\infty)$ and in space over the entire real line: $$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u_{t}\\varphi + f(u)_{x}\\varphi\\;dxdt = 0 $$\nThe last step is to integrate the first term by parts in time and the second term by parts in space:\n","date":1461110400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555459200,"objectID":"279b9966ca9cf3121ce924dca452bb1c","permalink":"/post/getting-started/","publishdate":"2016-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started/","section":"post","summary":"An introduction to solving nonlinear conservation laws.","tags":["Numerical PDE"],"title":"Numerical Methods for Conservation Laws","type":"post"},{"authors":["Justin Dong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1395115200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1395115200,"objectID":"d655a58787160e201681ae1670b11a4e","permalink":"/publication/undergrad-paper/","publishdate":"2014-03-18T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/undergrad-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"The modeling of three-phase fluid flow has many important applications in reservoir simulation.
