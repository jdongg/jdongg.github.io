      <description>I am a second year Ph.D. student in the Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown University. My research interests include scientific computing and numerical analysis of high-order methods for PDEs, especially as they pertain to problems in computational fluid dynamics. Presently, I am working on deep neural networks applied to PDEs with my advisor, Professor Mark Ainsworth. I am a recipient of the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
I am interested in increasing the participation of historically underrepresented groups in higher mathematics.</description>
